main.py :  Version 1.0 10/08/2016

General Usage Notes
-------------------

-The program supports Python 2.7
-The input to the program should be given as command line arguments 

Program Description
-------------------
Compute for each word w the tag t that maximizes P(t|w). Retag the training file with POS tags
that are most probable for a given word. Compute the error rate by comparing the
retagged file against the original tagged file. Now perform error analysis to find the
top-5 erroneously tagged words. Write at least five rules to do a better job of tagging
these top-5 erroneously tagged words, and show the difference in error rates. 

To run the program 
-------------------

In the terminal, enter the following commands:

pip install pandas
python main.py

Observation
-----------

Rules applied:
1) north succeeded by a word with a tag proper noun(NNP) will be an adjective(JJ)
2) north preceded by a determinant(DT) will be a noun(NN)
3) mid-January preceded by a noun(NN) and a (IN) respectively and followed by a (IN) will be an adjective(JJ)
4) cut preceded by a noun(NN) will be a verb past tense(VBD)
5) cut followed by a verb past tense(VBD) anywhere will be a verb past tense(VBD)
6) retired followed by a noun(NN) will be an adjective(JJ) 
7) -0- preceded by words containing a 7 either CD or RRB tagged will be a period(.)

newTagFile.txt : File having words with most probable tags
newFinalFile.txt : File after the rules have been applied
